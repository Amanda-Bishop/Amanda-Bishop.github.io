      <h1>The Problem</h1>
      <h3>Both physical and mental health issues are problems that plague astronauts. The general audience does not have much knowlege on how these issues can affect the lives of astronauts</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="two">
      <h1>The Solution</h1>
      <h3>We wanted to create an app that can help average people understand the risks that astronauts face. Although this is a partial solution as it does not get rid of these health risks, it could help people understand how taxing a trip in space can be on the human body. It is feasible because data is avaliable in reference to what we are trying to educate people on.</h3>

      <h1>Marketplace</h1>
      <h3>The closest competition on the market currently is other space apps which show the constelations above the user. Currently there is nothing similar on the market. This product would be sold through the app store and the value proposition would be that it is visually pleasing and also lets the user learn about space and it's affects on the human body. The app would be free so we would make money through ads and use this money to make sure that we are getting reputible information. We would want to partner with NASA since they are experts in this field. Key resources would be reputable sources, scientists to research for us, and visual designers.</h3></div>
