    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>Why Code Aurora was created last year when my sister and I realized how large the gender gap is in technology. We found out that at the University of Waterloo their first year Computer Science and Computer Engineering classes only have 20% women and this was a large number compared to other universities.  Since we feel that girls are just as capable as boys of going into a technology field we wanted to change this.  We ran an event in October where women in technology spoke to the girls in out community about their experiences as a woman in tech and encouraging these young girls to get interested in technology.  After the event I still felt that there was more I could do in my community to get girls interested in technology, so I came up with the idea for this summer camp.  The girls do not need to have any prior knowledge about technology because this course is meant for beginners.</p>
