        <p>I am a grade 10 student in Aurora. Carrie, Moss! First scene in Carrie! Oh. Okay We don't need no education. Yes you do. You've just used a double negative. Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN! Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. Yes! If there were such a thing as a drudgeon, that is what we'd be to them. I don't see how they couldn't just keep it as it was. How hard is it to remember 911?</p>
